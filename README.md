# dbz-api
I created a Dragon Ball Super api that gives you information about specific characters!

If you are wanting to use this api you will need to use npm install in your terminal.

Here is the main api link https://dbz-super-api.herokuapp.com/

If you would like to get specific characters please use this link format https://dbz-super-api.herokuapp.com/api/characterName

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

I built this api using Node.js. In order to make things easier to read for me, I used Express. I put the character objects locally on the server.js file just for simplicity sake. I served up an initial index.html file server side giving instruction on what api link to use.


## Optimizations

I'm going to input all of the character objects into a database in order to speed up the api.
